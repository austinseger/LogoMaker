SVG Logo Maker
Description
The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that generates a simple logo based on user input. Users can input custom text (up to three characters), choose the text and shape color, and select a shape (Circle, Triangle, or Square). The application then generates an SVG file and saves it in the examples/ folder as logo.svg.


Text for the logo (up to three characters)
Text color (you can use a color name or a hex value)
Shape (Circle, Triangle, or Square)
Shape color (color name or hex value)
Once all prompts are answered, an SVG file named logo.svg will be generated in the examples/ folder.

Open the logo.svg file in a browser or an SVG viewer to see the logo.
